## What is Canton Network?

Canton Network is a **privacy-enabled blockchain platform** designed for institutional and enterprise use cases where privacy is critical. Unlike traditional public blockchains where all transactions are visible to everyone, Canton enables:

- **Selective Visibility**: Parties only see transactions they're authorized to access
- **Confidential Smart Contracts**: Business logic written in DAML that preserves privacy
- **Institutional-Grade Security**: Built for regulated industries like finance and healthcare
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly connect with existing blockchain ecosystems

### Core Technologies
- **DAML**: Functional smart contract language designed for Canton.
- **DPM**: Smart Contract Framework for building and testing DAML applications
